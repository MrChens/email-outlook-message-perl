20020715  Recognize new items 'Cc', mime type of attachment, long
          filename of attachment, and full headers. Attachments turn out
          to be numbered, so a regexp is now used to recognize label of
          items that are attachments.
20020831  long file name will definitely be used if present. Full headers
          and mime type information are used when present. Created
          generic system for specifying known items to be skipped.
          Unexpected contents is never reason to bail out anymore. Added
          support for usage message and option processing (--verbose).
20040104  Handle address data slightly better, make From line less fake,
          make $verbose and $skippable_entries global vars, handle HTML
          variant of body text if present (though not optimally).
20040214  Fix typos and incorrect comments.
20040307  - Complete rewrite: All functional parts are now in the package
            MSGParser;
          - Creation of MIME::Entity object is delayed until the output
            routines, which means all data is known; This means I can
            create a multipart/alternative body.
          - Item names are parsed (thanks to bfrederi@alumni.sfu.ca for
            the information).
20040514  Check if $self->{HEAD} actually exists before trying to add its
          contents to the output Mime object's header data.
          (Bug reported by Thomas Ng).
          Don't produce multipart messages if not needed.
          (Bug reported by Justin B. Scout).
20040529  Correctly format OLEDATE.
20040530  - Extract date from property 0047 (thanks, Marc Goodman).
          - Use address data to make To: and Cc: lines complete
          - Use the in-reply-to property
          - More unknown properties named.
          - Found another property containing an SMTP address.
          - Put non-SMTP type addresses back in output.
20040825  Replace 'our' to declare globals with 'use vars'. This means
          the globals our now properly scoped inside the package and not
          the file.
          This also fixes the bug that this program did not work on perl
          versions below 5.6. (Bug reported by Tim Gustafson)
20060218  More sensible encoding warnings.
20060219  Move OLE parsing to main program.
          Parse nested MSG files (Bug reported by Christof Lukas).
20060225  Simplify code.
20060719  Keep MIME::Tools sedated.
